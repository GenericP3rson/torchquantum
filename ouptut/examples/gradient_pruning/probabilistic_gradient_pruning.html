<h2>Introduction to probabilistic gradient pruning<a class="headerlink" href="#Introduction-to-probabilistic-gradient-pruning" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>By carefully investigating the on-chip training process, we observe that small gradients tend to have large relative variations or even wrong directions under quantum noises. Also, not all gradient computations are necessary for the training process, especially for small-magnitude gradients.</p>
<p>The observations provide great opportunities for us to boost the robustness and efficiency of QNN on-chip learning. Inspired by that, we propose a <strong>probabilistic gradient pruning</strong> method to predict and only compute gradients of high reliability. Hence we can reduce noise impact and also save the required number of circuit runs on real quantum machines.</p>
<section id="Accumulation-Window-and-Pruning-Window">
<h3>Accumulation Window and Pruning Window<a class="headerlink" href="#Accumulation-Window-and-Pruning-Window" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We separate all the training epochs into a repeat of an accumulation window followed by a pruning window. There are three important hyper-parameters in our probabilistic gradient pruning method: - accumulation window width 𝑤𝑎, - pruning ratio 𝑟, - pruning window width 𝑤𝑝 .</p>
<p>In the accumulation window, we collect the information of gradients in each training step. In each step of the pruning window, we probabilistically exempt the calculations of some gradients based on the information collected from the accumulation window and pruning ratio.</p>
<div align="center"><p><img alt="conv-full-layer" class="no-scaled-link" src="https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum/blob/master/figs/probabilistic_gradient_pruning.png?raw=true" style="width: 800px;" /></p>
</div><p>The accumulation window width and pruning window width decide the reliability of the gradient trend evaluation and our confidence in it, respectively. The pruning ratio can be tuned to balance the gradient variances caused by noise perturbation and pruning. Thus, the percentage of the time saved by our probabilistic gradient pruning method is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(𝑟\frac{𝑤𝑝}{𝑤𝑎+𝑤𝑝}× 100%\)</span>. In our experiments, we find that the setting (𝑤𝑎=1, 𝑤𝑝=2∼3, 𝑟=0.3∼0.5) usually works well in all cases</p>

<span class="ansi-yellow-fg">  DEPRECATION: A future pip version will change local packages to be built in-place without first copying to a temporary directory. We recommend you use --use-feature=in-tree-build to test your packages with this new behavior before it becomes the default.
   pip 21.3 will remove support for this functionality. You can find discussion regarding this at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7555.</span>
